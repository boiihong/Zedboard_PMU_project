# Zedboard_PMU_project
Using Performance Monitoring Unit in Zedboard

Project Name: The research on hardware trojan detection, protection and countermeasures.
Funding Institution: South Korea National Institute of Scientific Research.
Duration: From March to October 2015.
My role: Implementing bare-metal program to monitor an processor performance like cache miss, branch predict miss, and cycle count etc. 
Detailed description: The program consists of two parts. One is a performance monitoring part which is running on Zedboard and the other is visualization part which is continuously displaying results. The first part is implemented with C/ASM and the second part is implemented with JAVA. Figure. 1 describes a flow of the running system. ①A target program to be monitored is executed. ②A preconfigured private timer interrupt halts the target program and send the PMU data to host pc through a serial interconnection. ③A final result is dynamically visualized by a java program running on x86 host pc.
